# _Salsola tragus_ Genome Report

# Overview

This repository includes scripts and files generated during the analysis of the _Salsola tragus_ reference genome and serves as a supplimental resource to the publication titled "Assembly and Annotation of the Tetraploid Salsola tragus (Russian thistle) Genome". 

## Assembly Statistics 

The reference assemblies for Haplome 1 and Haplome 2 were analyzed using [Assembleathon](https://github.com/KorfLab/Assemblathon/blob/master/assemblathon_stats.pl). 

## Assembly subgenome phasing visualization

Subgenome phasing visualization for Haplome 1 and Haplome 2 were performed using [SubPhaser](https://github.com/zhangrengang/SubPhaser). 

## Subgenome synteny analysis

Visualization of synteny between the A and B subgenomes in Haplome 1 was performed using `samtools`, `minimap2`, `mummer`, and `showcoords` in the pipeline `A_vs_B.sh`
